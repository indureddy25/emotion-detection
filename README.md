# 😊 Emotion Detection System 😡😢

An **Emotion Detection System** that identifies human emotions in real time using **computer vision and deep learning**.  
The system detects faces from a webcam and predicts emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprise, and neutral**.

## 📌 Project Description

The Emotion Detection System uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze facial expressions from live video input.  
It processes each video frame, detects faces, and classifies emotions with high accuracy in real time.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Real-time face detection using webcam  
- 😊 Detects multiple emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral)  
- 🤖 Deep learning–based emotion analysis  
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained emotion recognition model  
- 🖥️ Displays emotion label on detected face  
- ⚡ Fast and efficient processing  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- DeepFace  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. Captures live video using a webcam  
2. Detects faces in each video frame  
3. Extracts facial features  
4. Uses deep learning model to predict emotion  
5. Displays detected emotion in real time  

## 🎯 Use Cases
